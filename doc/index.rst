MediaWiki Types
===============
This library provides a set of standardized types to be used when processing
MediaWiki data.  All of the types in this package make use of `jsonable
<https://github.com/halfak/python-jsonable/>`_ and therefor can be trivially
serialized as JSON documents.

:Installation: ``pip install mwtypes``

This package is a work in progress, so many types are not implemented.  But
those types that *are* implemented are complete and well-tested.
